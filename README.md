# order-icons
Gnome Shell extension for ordering icons in the top bar like for Ubuntu unity

## Install
Either install it via github or enable via extensions.gnome.org

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2114/order-gnome-shell-extensions/

## How to

The icons for each panel (left, right and center) can be ordered using the Extension preferences. When opening the preferences the currently detected indicators are listed and you can put them in any order that you want. 

Note that this extension is the one determining the order, any ordering done by other apps (and / or extensions) will be overwritten.


## Disclaimer

I made that extension for myself because I was annoyed by the fact that it was always changing the order when I was locking unlocking. It might very well be the case that this extension breaks your computer and only works on my setup. So use at your own risk and/or write a bug report and I will try to fix it. 

I am not a Javascript developer so improvements on how to do it are very much welcome!
